# Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis Lab

## Overview
This project demonstrates hands-on network traffic analysis using Wireshark. 
It covers packet capturing, protocol identification, filtering techniques, and analysis of common network protocols.

## Objectives
- Capture live network packets using Wireshark
- Identify common network protocols
- Analyze TCP 3-Way Handshake
- Filter traffic using Wireshark display filters
- Examine HTTPS, DNS, and ARP traffic

## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Command Line (ping)
- Web Browser

## Lab Tasks Performed
1. Packet Capture
2. Protocol Identification
3. TCP 3-Way Handshake Analysis
4. Packet Filtering using Display Filters
5. HTTPS Traffic Analysis
6. DNS Traffic Analysis
7. ARP Traffic Analysis

## Key Protocols Observed
- TCP
- UDP
- DNS
- HTTPS (TLS)
- ARP

## Screenshots
Screenshots included in this repository show:
- Live packet captures
- Applied display filters
- TCP handshake flags (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)
- DNS queries and responses
- ARP request and reply packets

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of how data flows across networks
- Practical experience analyzing encrypted and unencrypted traffic
- Familiarity with Wireshark filters and protocol behavior
